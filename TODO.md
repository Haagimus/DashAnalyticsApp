#TODO List
- [ ] Create an index/home page that will allow navigation to individual pages as they are created
- [ ] Figure out how to run the Dash server non local host
- [ ] Create "modules" for running individual pages on the Dash server so they can be updated without changing the entire page (also this will keep it from becoming one huge file to maintain)
